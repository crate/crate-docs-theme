================

This project provides a Sphinx theme for Crate's documentation
that is compatible with ReadTheDocs.

Using the theme
---------------

In your docs ``conf.py`` import the settings from the theme::

   from crate.theme.rtd.conf import *

or if you want to use a specific configuration::

   from crate.theme.rtd.conf.crate_server import *

That's all!

Development
-----------

The project uses buildout to bootstrap::

    python bootstrap.py

    bin/buildout -N

This will install ``NodeJs`` and the required modules.

*Note*: if you get an error running ``bin/buildout``, try running ``python bin/buildout`` instead.

There is a watcher that compiles ``.less`` files into ``.css``::

    bin/grunt watch

or compile on demand with the ``recess`` command::

    bin/grunt recess

That will compile the ``.less`` files into
``src/crate/theme/rtd/crate/static/css/main.css``

In order to build a documentation for testing purposes,
place your rst files into the ``docs/`` folder
and use ``sphinx`` to build the docs with the theme::

    bin/sphinx
