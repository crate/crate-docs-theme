Crate Docs Theme
================

|tests| |rtd| |build| |pypi|

A `Sphinx`_ theme for the `Crate documentation`_.

*Note: This theme is tightly integrated into the Crate.io website and is
not intended for general use.*

For help making changes to the theme, see the `developer docs`_.


Using the theme
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

The documentation can include UML diagrams which will be rendered using
`sphinxcontrib-plantuml`_. In order to satisfy its requirements, run::

    # On Linux
    apt-get install plantuml

    # On macOS
    brew install plantuml

.. _sphinxcontrib-plantuml: https://pypi.org/project/sphinxcontrib-plantuml/

Installation
------------

The Crate docs theme is available as a package on `PyPI`_. However, there is no
need to install it yourself. Crate projects that use the theme should install
it automatically.


Configuration
-------------

The Crate.io documentation is composed of multiple separate documentation
projects, seamlessly interlinked via the Crate docs theme.

To use the theme, add this line to your Sphinx ``conf.py`` file::

   from crate.theme.rtd.conf.foo import *

Here, replace ``foo`` with the appropriate module for your documentation
project.


Contributing
============

This project is primarily maintained by `Crate.io`_, but we welcome community
contributions!

See the `developer docs`_ and the `contribution docs`_ for more information.
