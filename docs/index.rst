        This is the meta description, it should be between 150-300 characters.
        Meta descriptions are used for display but not for ranking.

This documentation is a stub.

.. NOTE::

    This is a friendly note.

    This is a second paragraph also notifying you that this is a note.

What is a list?

* It has bullet points like this one
* The list items are spaced close together like subsequent lines in a paragraph
* Typically the items are short and are not terminated with a period

An open list is quite different:

.. rst-class:: open

* Notice how this sentence is terminated with a period.

  And there's a second paragraph too.

* This is the second item. Notice how it is separated from the first item like
  a regular paragraph would be.

This is a regular paragraph and not a list item.
