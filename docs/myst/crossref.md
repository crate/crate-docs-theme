# Cross-references

Being able to use cross-references appropriately, i.e. optimally linking between
documentation resources, even across projects, is important for documentation
authoring. Please refer to [MyST cross-references](inv:myst#syntax/referencing),
in order to learn about how this works using the Markdown markup language.

By using cross-references properly, maintenance efforts regarding broken links will
be greatly reduced, because all target references will be validated at build time.
